My implementation of the task given was tackled in two stages. First I did the semantic checks and the java bytecode afterwards. I have used the lexer and parser you have provided since it seemed closest to what you want us to test with. Although it has some issues with how it parses negative numbers and nested if statements without an elseâ€™s which messes up my recursive methods for it at some times. I will not go into detail what I have done here since most of the code is well documented and as you will see the variables used inside are self-explanatory. I basically used several separate objects to hold the information on the set during the semantic checking and called multiple functions that I wrote. Again I am sorry that it is pretty vague but If I started explaining what each of the functions did then I would be reading the comments and JavaDoc that are in the files that I have provided. The second part I did not manage to finish but did most of it. I still have to implement  the function returns for example. All the functions that I wrote are being called within themselves and can be traced to the javCompiler which acts as a main method for my assignment. the compiler's functins are in that file and the Semantic checker functions are inside SemanticCheck.
